JavaScript Minesweeper Implementation

Created By: Gary Hill

This is my version of an old favorite. I take no credit for the concept or rules this game. My intention was solely to increase my knowledge of client side development technologies while working on a fun project. I used the following technologies and patterns in the creation of this game...

JavaScript
jQuery v1.11
Bootstrap v3.2
BootstrapValidator v.05
Font Awesome v4.1
RequireJS v2.1.14
Modernizr v2.8.3
HTML5
CSS3
Revealing Module Pattern
Publish/Subscriber Pattern
